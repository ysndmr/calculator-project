# Calculator App

The calculator is a simple and intuitive web-based tool that provides basic arithmetic operations and additional functionalities. It is designed to be user-friendly and versatile, catering to various calculation needs. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide on how to use it and what each function does:

## How to Use the Calculator

### Basic Arithmetic Operations:

- **Entering Numbers:** Click on the number buttons (0-9) to enter numbers. The numbers will appear in the display section at the top.
- **Addition (+):** Click the `+` button to add two numbers. For example, to calculate 5 + 3, click `5`, `+`, `3`, and then `=`.
- **Subtraction (-):** Click the `-` button to subtract one number from another. For example, to calculate 7 - 2, click `7`, `-`, `2`, and then `=`.
- **Multiplication (\*):** Click the `*` button to multiply two numbers. For example, to calculate 4 _ 3, click `4`, `_`, `3`, and then `=`.
- **Division (/):** Click the `/` button to divide one number by another. For example, to calculate 10 / 2, click `10`, `/`, `2`, and then `=`.
- **Equals (=):** Click the `=` button to get the result of the arithmetic operation.

### Memory Functions:

- **M+ (Memory Add):** Adds the current value to the memory. This function is useful for cumulative calculations. For example, if you want to add multiple numbers together, you can use M+ to store the sum temporarily.
- **MR (Memory Recall):** Recalls the value stored in the memory. This allows you to use the stored value in further calculations.
- **MC (Memory Clear):** Clears the memory. This function is used to reset the memory value to zero.

### Special Functions:

- **C (Clear):** Clears the current input, resetting the display to 0. This is useful if you make a mistake or want to start a new calculation.
- **del (Delete):** Deletes the last digit of the current input. This is useful for correcting input errors without clearing the entire number.
- **% (Percentage):** Converts the current value to a percentage. For example, if you enter 50 and press %, the display will show 0.5 (which is 50% of 1).
- **sin/cos/tan (Trigonometric Functions):** Applies the respective trigonometric function to the current value. These functions are useful for scientific calculations:
  - **sin:** Calculates the sine of an angle (in radians).
  - **cos:** Calculates the cosine of an angle (in radians).
  - **tan:** Calculates the tangent of an angle (in radians).

### Theme Toggle:

Use the theme switch to toggle between light and dark modes. This allows you to customize the appearance of the calculator according to your preference. The selected theme is saved in your browser's local storage, so your preference will be retained even if you reload the page or close and reopen the browser.

## Additional Features

- **Responsive Design:** The calculator is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring it works seamlessly on different devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The layout is intuitive, with clearly labeled buttons and a clean design that makes it easy to use for people of all ages.
- **Error Handling:** The calculator includes basic error handling to manage invalid inputs or operations, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Project Structure

This project is a static web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. The use of jQuery simplifies DOM manipulation and enhances the interactive features of the calculator.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Provides the structure of the calculator interface.
- **CSS:** Styles the interface to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **jQuery:** Simplifies JavaScript coding for handling events and DOM manipulation.
